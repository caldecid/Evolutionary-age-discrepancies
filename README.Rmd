## Repository of "On the estimation of species age from phylogenetic trees"


R scripts, functions and data to replicate the analysis in the manuscript. This repository follows the computational notebook structure proposed by Figueiredo et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010356)


The manuscripts possesses four methodological sections (associated to three folders): i) Quantitative error and ii) Qualitative error (quantifying_error); iii) Stochastic ages function (stochastic_sp_age); and iv) Extinction signal (conservation_status). The folders are inside "data/processed/" and "scripts" folder. Inside the latter there is also the "Functions" folder which has the necessary functions for running our analysis.
